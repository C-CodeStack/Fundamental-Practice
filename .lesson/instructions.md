## Problem 1
Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

returns the time since midnight in seconds.

h = 3
m = 5
s = 2

result = 10987

example: (3,5,2) -> 10987

hints: search "hours to minutes" and "minutes to seconds" and "js operators" also remember order of operations, you will need parenthesis

#
## Problem 2
Write code that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

example: ([1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]) -> 9.2

hints: search "js for loops" and "js += operator"
#
## Problem 3
Write code which converts the input string to uppercase.

example: ("input") -> "INPUT"

hints: search "js letters to upper case"

#
## Problem 4
given a number you have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

example: (3) -> -3

example: (-5) -> -5

hints: search "js if"
#
## Problem 5
Create code with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

example: (1,10) -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

example: (2,5) -> [2,4,6,8,10]

hints: search "js operators" and "js add to an array"
#
## Problem 6
Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.

example: ([1,"1"]) -> 2

example: (["2","3",3]) -> 8

hints: search "js string to number" and  "js for loop"
#
## Problem 7
multiplying a given number by eight if it is an even number and by nine otherwise.

example: (8) -> 64

example: (3) -> 27

hints: search "js if" and "js operators"
#
## Problem 8
Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

example: ([2,3]) -> [4,6]

example: (3,3,9,1) -> [6,6,18,2]

hints: search "js for loop" and "js add to array"
#
## Problem 9
Your goal is to create code that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

example: ("hello") -> "ell"

example: ("drones") -> "rone"

hints: search "js string slice"
#
## Problem 10
You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

example: ("green") -> "yellow"

example: ("red") -> "green"

hints: search "js if else if" and "js operators"
